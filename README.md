## Problem 1 - 47 points

**Video Poker:**  Do PROGRAMMING PROJECT  Project P7.9 in the 6th Edition of Big Java 
 
You must follow the instructions below to receive credit for this assignment. 
 
Instead of your player betting a single token each time, allow the player to bet between 1-5 tokens. If a player bets *n* tokens they win *n* times as much as indicated in the textbook prompt.  

Your program must use the included templates. These templates are for the classes: Card, Deck, Game, Player, and a test class, TestPoker. You will need to fill-in the existing methods and may want to add more methods and/or instance variables to any or all of these classes except for the test class TestPoker. TestPoker must remain exactly as it is here. 

This project requires you to have two versions of your game each constructed using a different version of the Game constructor. One will require an explicit parameter that you will get as a command-line argument, this is to help you (and us) test your code. That is, it will allow the user to specify the hand that the player gets which will help in testing if your game correctly identifies the various hands. Carefully read the comments in the template files to help you understand how this will work.

## Problem 2 - 3 points

Templates for the five source files are located in the Assignment 4 workspace on Codio. In addition to the source files  include a text file named readMe.txt with an explanation of how your program works. That is, write in plain English, instructions for using your software, explanations for how and why you chose to design your code the way you did. The readMe.txt file is also an opportunity for you to get partial credit when certain requirements of the assignment are not met. 

### A word about Grading:
Each programming question on assignment will be graded as follows:

* 20% if it compiles
* 65% if it runs properly (expected output for given input, etc.)
* 5% for style (formatting of code, variable names, comments, etc. Use the style guide posted on Coursworks!)
* 10% for design (efficiency, class  organization, method length, etc...)

Please make sure your programs at least compile before you submit them! We will no longer be giving partial credit for programs that do not compile at all.
